      <p class="mission-explanation">  LessonTree is an open-source web application which utilizes
        a lesson sharing network in order to redefine how teachers create, edit, &amp; share lessons
        amongst other educators &amp; themselves. Our objective centers around maximizing non-teaching time
        outside of the classroom to increase efficiency. </p>

      <p class="more-mission">  LessonTree’s community network promotes accurate &amp; usable rubrics,
        functional plans, highly vetted documentation, &amp; lessens time constraints so that more effective
        teaching occurs inside the classroom.</p>

      <p class="just-a-little-more-mission"> Our collaborative workspace includes in-browser editing of
        documents &amp; the ability to “branch” lessons to new projects in order to provide an all-inclusive,
        yet user friendly experience. The best part- it’s free! We hope you enjoy what LessonTree
        has to offer.</p>
